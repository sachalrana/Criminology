### Overview - Crimes in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C and New York City

Crime rate is quite high in the U.S, especially in the cities of Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C and NYC. This probably is the case because these are one of the most populated places in the US and the tourism is quite high in these cities. 

We can use the analysis to better inform the people living/visiting these areas about the what and when of the crimes and at the same time help the law enforcement agencies to better serve the citizens.

The following map highlights the crimes occuring in the 4 cities.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
